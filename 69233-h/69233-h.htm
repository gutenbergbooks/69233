<p class="drop-capy">THE following Examination was drawn up in
the country, from a casual perusal of Mr.
Harris’s Scriptural Researches, with a view of putting
them into the hands of any person, who might
be employed in answering that very extraordinary
work. But on coming up to town, and understanding
that Mr. Harris’s reasoning had produced
effects on certain people, who had not studied
the scriptures, or attended to that spirit of freedom,
which runs throughout the Old and New
Testament, and who hitherto had suffered themselves
to be reluctantly dragged along by the present
prevailing enthusiasm in favour of freedom,
but now eagerly seized on a pretence for abandoning
the cause, it has been judged proper to give
it at once to the publick. Mr. Harris affects
to proceed mathematically in the treatment of his
subject, and therefore establishes certain data. I
had thought it sufficient to contradict their particular
application, in my examination of the subject;
but others thinking it necessary to take
more direct notice of them, I have subjoined the
following short observations.</p>

<p>Dat. 1, 2. “The scriptures of the Old and
New Testament are of equal authority, and contain
the unerring decisions of the word of God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Observation. Certainly: but it will not be
disputed, that there are many things, not indeed
deserving the name of decisions, but that pass
without censure, and are seemingly allowed there,
which we know to be forbidden to us, and which
will not apply to the improved state of mankind.
Laws must be adapted, not only to the state of
society, but to the present state of the improvement
of the human mind, which we know has
been gradually advancing from the earliest ages.</p>

<p>Dat. 3, 4. “It is criminal to refuse assent
to what the scriptures decide to be intrinsically
good or bad.”</p>

<p>Obser. Suppose this. Yet may we not inquire
if a thing or practice be really so declared, and
if it concerns our salvation, to form a decided
opinion on it? Are we not liable to mistake practices,
arising out of circumstances connected with
the first formation of society, and therefore not
positively censured, for such decisions of intrinsical
goodness? Thus the eating of swines flesh was allowed
before the promulgation of the law of
Moses; that law strictly forbad it; the Christian
law allows it again as at the beginning: or, the
Jews were alone restrained from the use of it;
while they continued under a particular œconomy,
and their transgression of this law was only a crime,
because it was enjoined them; not because it was
in itself a thing unlawful, as murder, adultery,
and the like.</p>

<p>Dat. 5, 6. “Every scriptural decision, however
incomprehensible, must be assented to as a
declaration of the word of God.” We must consider
the circumstances under which that decision
is made; how far it is agreeable to our benevolent
religion, and how far it is applicable to our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
conduct, before we imitate it. The drunken incest
of Lot is not censured. It was the means of
producing two mighty nations; from which, according
to the author’s manner of reasoning, he
ought to conclude it was approved of; yet I suppose
he will not recommend the imitation to any
person in these days.</p>

<p>Dat. 7. “The slave-trade must be believed
to be intrinsically just and lawful, if the scriptures
give a sanction to it.” Suppose the slave-trade
to have this sanction (which yet is not true) unless
the author can shew how it can be carried on without
infringing on our Saviour’s golden rule, of doing
as we would be done by; unless he can instruct
us how we can go to the coast of Africa, and by
every fraudulent, violent, oppressive method, rob,
murder, and enslave innocent people without a
crime; then are we to keep our practice, if not
our opinion, suspended.</p>

<p>Dat. 8. “No abuse of a lawful pursuit, can
make that pursuit criminal.” It is lawful for
a man to provide for his family; but not to rob
and murder on the highway under such a pretence.
Whenever a man’s industry is connected with
such practices, the actual exertion of it is a crime
in him, though to provide for his family in an
honest way would be laudable. That there is an
unlawful slavery noticed in the scriptures, is clear,
from the punishment that Pharaoh brought on
himself and Ægypt, for enslaving the Jews. The
author should distinguish, and mark the difference
between the slavery that (page 41) is almost commanded,
and that which brings down divine judgments
on the oppressor, and shew that his patrons
of Leverpool practise only the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Dat. 9. “No private or publick advantage
will ever justify the slave-trade, till it be
proved essentially just and lawful in its nature.”
Here we are sincerely agreed; and according to
the distinction proposed for datum 8, he has only
to set heartily to work, and prove the Leverpool
slave-trade to be that particular sort of slave-trade,
“which God hath commanded as being
essentially just and lawful in its nature.”</p>

<p>Dat. 10. “No argument drawn from abuse,
can prove the intrinsic deformity of the slave-trade,
unless it be proved essentially unjust.”
These are words without meaning. We are not
combating an ideal slavery; but slavery accompanied
with robbery, oppression, misery, murder.
Wherever we find slavery so attended, it becomes
a horrid crime, be it intrinsically never so just.</p>

<p>Dat. 11. “If abuses committed in the prosecution
of a lawful pursuit can be prevented, then
the advantages arising from it, ought to have a
powerful influence against the abolition.” But if
these abuses cannot possibly be prevented (for are
we to oppress and murder according to law?) then
the greatest advantages attending any practice
must be abandoned, till a method shall be discovered,
of separating them from iniquity and blood-shed.</p>

<p>Dat. 12. “If the slave-trade is to be abolished,
because of the abuses committed in it, then
every other branch of trade, in which abuses are
committed, ought to share the same fate.” Most
certainly in turn, in proportion to the atrociousness
of each. Let us once get this staring monster
subdued, and we will be obliged to the author
for pointing out any other iniquitous traffick
that deserves to follow immediately in the train<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of the Leverpool slave-trade. The fallaciousness
of this author’s reasoning, is exceedingly well exposed,
in the Critical Review of April, 1788, to
which I refer the reader.</p>

<p>From this view of the author’s data, it will appear,
that he has totally confounded times and
circumstances. The law of Moses was enacted in
aid of natural religion, till the perfect religion of
Christ should be given to the world. The doctrines
of this last, enjoin us to consider and treat
all men as our brethren; and its effect was gradually
to take away all burthensome ceremonies,
all oppressive distinctions. Why are we then
sent back to less perfect institutions for the rule
of our practice? We are to go on to perfection,
refine sentiment, and extend benevolence. What
has raised Europe above the rest of the world, but
the abolition of domestick slavery? What degrees
of opulence and prosperity might it acquire, if
the abominable, contracted, branch of trade in the
bodies of our fellow creatures of Africa, were
changed to a fair, equitable intercourse of productions
and manufactures!</p>

<p class="p2 drop-capy">THIS gentleman professes to treat the subject
seriously, and to submit his opinion to
the decisions of revealed religion. No man has
a right to dispute his sincerity, as far as his own
way of thinking is concerned; but few serious
people will peruse his extraordinary positions,
without having their reverence for their Creator
shocked, and their benevolence to their brother
affected. The Scriptures, from which he draws
his conclusions, we believe to teach, that all men
are equally dear to their Creator, and that we
owe love and good offices to each other. But if
his deductions be fairly made, we must no longer
entertain this opinion; for one part of mankind
is to be kidnapped, evil intreated, oppressed,
murdered, to indulge the avarice of another;
and, page 76, Corol. 3d. “He doth not believe
the Scriptures, who is not persuaded that this
doctrine is taught there.”</p>

<p>But the author stumbles at the very threshold.
Our Saviour (John v. 39.) bids the Jews to search
the scriptures; “for in them ye think ye have
eternal life; for they are they which testify of
me,” the Saviour come to free men from the
bondage of sin, into the glorious privilege of the
sons of God. But it seems something else is
meant. We are to search the scriptures (see title
page) for a commission to Leverpool captains for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
fitting out ships, and loading them with powder,
shot, and cutlasses, to set the Africans on to
assault, kidnap, and enslave each other; to be
transferred over to them; to be murdered by bad
air, thirst, and famine, in the passage to the West-Indies;
where the poor remains are to be set to
hard labour, without food, without cloathing,
without rest, sufficient to support nature.</p>

<p>It is true (preface, page 5.) he, with all the
other advocates for slavery, declares himself “an
enemy to injustice and oppression.” But the
design of his book is to shew, that the ill-treatment
of slaves is not an object of divine animadversion;
for (p. 16.) Sarah was permitted without
censure, “to use cruel oppressive treatment
to Hagar;” and (p. 26.) Joseph is approved of
by God for the cruel manner in which he enslaved
and exchanged the abodes of the Egyptians.
Which of these is to be believed; his general
assertion, or his particular application? Or may
we conclude, that he reserves to himself the feelings
of humanity, and sells tyranny and oppression
to his friends of Leverpool.</p>

<p>In the scriptures servants are frequently mentioned;
but, in this dissertation, they are transformed
into “slave trade.” The places, where
traffick in slaves is related, are Joseph’s brethren
(Gen. xxxvii.) selling him to the Ishmaelites,
who sell him to Potiphar; the Tyrians (Ezek.
xxvii. 13.) who had a market for the persons of
men; and Babylon, the mother of abominations,
(Rev. xviii. 13.) who exposed to sale, slaves and
souls of men. I hope none of these instances are
proposed to the imitation of the “ancient and
loyal town of Leverpool;” for a black mark is
set on them to prevent them from being followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>Now there is some difference between dealing in
slaves as a branch of trade, and buying the service
of a domestic; even as it is not every man who eats
meat, that is or could act the part of a butcher. In the
case of the Jews there was something particular.
They were obliged to admit their slaves to all
the national privileges, to circumcision, the passover,
and other solemn feasts, and to instruct
them in the true religion (Gen. xvii. 13. Exod.
xii. 44. Deut. xvi. 11. and xxxi. 12. Josh. viii.
35.) In buying them from the Heathen around
them, they recovered them from idolatry; they
gave them a weekly sabbath. In their treatment
they were commanded to remember, that they
themselves had been slaves in Egypt. When
they are threatened for their sins, the ill treatment
of their slaves makes a capital part of the
charge against them. But modern masters think
that nothing of this sort concerns them.</p>

<p>The Jews were intended to communicate to
the world the knowledge of the true religion.
He who brings good out of evil made use of the
slavery, in practice, to extend this knowledge to
persons, whom it could not at that time have
otherwise reached. But nothing in the bible
countenances a trade in slaves. Even the transferring
them in ordinary cases is checked as in
that of wives and concubines (Exod. xxi. 11.)
Their ill treatment was guarded against, by that
law which gave them freedom if their master
had struck out a single tooth.</p>

<p>Indeed, among the Jews, the number of slaves
must have been small. They were numerous in
a narrow territory, and were in general husband-men,
and used ploughs and other instruments of
agriculture, and wrought in the field with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
servants. Ziba, who appears to have been steward
to the house of Saul, had only twenty servants
to assist him and his sons in cultivating the lands
belonging to the family. The Jews on their return
from captivity had only one servant to six
persons, or one in each family. The remnant of
the Gibeonites, who served the temple, was then
392. It is not therefore fair to consider every
accidental possession of a servant, either as an instance,
or as a vindication of the Leverpool
“slave trade;” of which no ancient nation could
ever form an idea. We may rather conclude,
that though the Jews were permitted to buy
slaves from the Heathen, they did not traffick in
them; and forcibly to enslave their brethren was
death. (See Exod. xxi. 16. Deut. xxiv. 7.)</p>

<p>Of Mr. Harris’s data as general propositions, I
shall say little more; the application alone is what
the present subject is concerned in. I shall only
suggest an additional datum, as necessary to complete
his principles of reasoning.</p>

<p>Dat. 13. If the slave trade, though “intrinsically
licit,” cannot now be carried on, without
breaking through every human and divine law,
without cheating, violence, oppression, murder,
then must it be laid aside, till we shall have discovered
a way of carrying it on, agreeably to the
doctrines of the gospel, by which we are enjoined
to consider all men as our brethren, and to deal by
them as we wish them to deal by us.</p>

<p>Page 16. Speaking of Abraham’s possessing of
servants, he calls it, “a positive approbation, a
sanction of divine authority in favour of the slave-trade.”
What a change is put on the Reader!
Abraham possessed servants; therefore the Leverpool
slave-trade has a divine sanction. For if this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
be not meant, nothing is meant. His book is
published to vindicate this trade; it is dedicated to
the corporation, who must so understand it. Now
let a man only read Mr. Newton or Mr. Falconbridge’s,
or any other eye-witness’s account of this
trade, and what horrid impiety must of necessity
be understood! Is there “a divine sanction” for
all the iniquity accompanying this very diabolical
business, the kidnapping, chaining, murdering,
suffocating of millions of unhappy fellow creatures?
Are such things not barely permitted, but
(p. 42.) approved, encouraged, and seemingly
enjoined?</p>

<p>Abraham was a rich, powerful, prince. As he
travelled through various countries, numbers
must have been desirous of attaching themselves
to his fortune, and have offered themselves for his
attendants. His humanity might have induced
him to purchase children from unnatural parents,
or captives from robbers. But all in his family
were in a situation very different from that of
West Indian slaves. We learn, that on the supposition
of his dying childless, he intended one
of them for his heir; that he intrusted a servant
to chuse a wife for his son Isaac; that he put arms
in his servants hands, and led them out to battle.
There is nothing of West Indian slavery in all
this.</p>

<p>But a particular stress is laid on the story of
Hagar, and Sarah’s ill treatment of her. Page 19.
“She obtained no favourable sentence from the
Divine Tribunal for leaving her mistress, nor was
Sarah censured for her severity.” Sarah was not
present when the angel appeared unto Hagar,
therefore she is neither praised nor condemned.
But that Hagar believed she had a favourable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
sentence, and that her conduct was not condemned,
when assured that the Lord had seen her affliction,
which is the scripture phrase for deliverance
(Gen. xxix. 32. and xxxi. 42. Exod. iii. 7.),
and that she should have a son, and that her seed
should be multiplied, appears from her acknowledgment
of the vision, and returning to her mistress.
Nor can we imagine in what more flattering
manner her affliction could have been recompensed,
or how she could have been afflicted so
as to have deserved a recompence, and her mistress
not to have been in fault. It was necessary
for her to return to her mistress, that her son might
partake of the sign of the covenant, and be instructed
in the true religion.</p>

<p>Hagar’s case (p. 19.) is compared with an
African female slave in the West Indies. Nothing
can be more opposite. Josephus says,
Pharaoh made Abraham a present of money; and
the scriptures say, that he intreated Abraham well
for Sarah’s sake, adding immediately, he had
cattle, and men servants, and maid servants, as
if Pharaoh had presented them; among whom
Hagar might have been one; or, as it appears
she was a worshipper of the true God, she might
voluntarily have entered into Sarah’s service.
Certainly she had never been cooped up in a
Guinea trader, nor set to plant the sugar-cane;
nor was she ordered to return and submit herself
for her mistress’s profit, but for her own and her
son’s sake; and when that purpose was answered
she was dismissed.</p>

<p>There is therefore no foundation for the author’s
deduction, p. 20. that “a divine voice declares
her to be her master’s indisputable property,
and the original bargain to be just and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
lawful in its nature; and that the (Leverpool)
slave-trade, even attended with circumstances
not conformable to the feelings of humanity, is
essentially confident with the rights of justice,
and has the positive sanction of God for its support,
however displeasing these circumstances may
be to his fatherly providence.” Let any man make
sense of this who can. I understand only the extreme
boldness of the expression. Here is a right
to enslave and an approbation, and also a censure
of the exercise of this right. Here our natural
notions of benevolence are set in opposition to
revelation, p. 42. Revelation commands us to
enslave our brethren, even against the suggestions
of the feelings of humanity. Surely the writer
should shew the high purposes answered by slavery,
to gain which it is an act of piety to violate our
benevolent feelings.</p>

<p>We come now to the story of Joseph, which,
p. 23, “ascertains the inherent lawfulness of the”
(Leverpool) “slave-trade.” The first thing that
strikes us in his account is, his illustrating his doctrine
by Joseph’s political arrangements of the
kingdom of Egypt, rather than by Joseph’s own
story; which, except in the horrid circumstances
of the middle passage, agrees entirely with the
Leverpool slave-trade. Joseph is found at a distance
from protection. His enemies kidnap him
and sell him to slave-brokers, who carry him into
Egypt, and dispose of him as an article of commerce
to Potiphar. His kidnappers saw, and
like Guinea captains disregarded, the anguish of
his soul. It is true, afterwards, when they believed
themselves in danger of being enslaved in
turn, they upbraid each other with their unfeeling
cruelty, and charge their distress to its account.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
But this was only because Scriptural Researches
had not then been published: for they, p. 20,
would have proved, that “though the action was
not altogether conformable to the feelings of
humanity, and was even displeasing to his Fatherly
Providence; and though doubtless God would
see, and of consequence recompense, Joseph for
his affliction as he had Hagar; yet this stroke in
the slave-trade is essentially consistent with the
unalienable rights of justice; has the positive
sanction of God in its support, nay, his approbation,
p. 16, and p. 42, even his command.”</p>

<p>But let us examine Joseph’s management of
the Egyptians, not as this author, but as the
scriptures represent it. In the years of plenty
Joseph stored the extraordinary produce of each
district in the neighbouring cities. One tenth
part belonged of right to the king; the rest he purchased
at a low price with the king’s treasures. In
the years of famine he sold the corn out to the inhabitants
of the districts nearest to his respective store-houses
at an advanced price, and accumulated the
money, cattle, and moveables of the whole kingdom,
and at last made a bargain for their lands and
persons. It is not to be supposed that any property,
except money, was taken out of the original possessors
hands; for this would have answered no
purpose, but to distress the people and embarrass
government. Indeed, where could the whole cattle
and moveables of the kingdom have been stored?
When the seven years of famine were ended, Pharaoh
was the sole proprietor. Joseph then gives
the inhabitants a charter, restores them their
lands and cattle, on condition of paying to Pharaoh
a second tenth of the produce of the land,
which made their contributions to the revenue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
a fifth part of their crops. It appears no other
badge or burden of slavery was imposed, except
this rent, which was a tenth part more than they
had formerly paid.</p>

<p>The common rent of the bare land in England
is estimated at one-third of the produce, and the
farmer must supply himself with stock, except
perhaps buildings, and also contribute largely in
a variety of ways to the publick revenues: but by
Joseph’s regulation the Egyptian farmer paid only
a fifth part for the use of his stock and land, and
for the support of government. After having transferred
themselves and property to Pharaoh, they
could not have been freed on easier terms: and as
we often see, that he who hires a farm, grows rich
on a possession on which the owner had been ruined,
probably the Egyptians became as happy under
their new tenure as they had been under their
old. In the most unfavourable light, it may be
compared with the change that took place at the
conquest, when free tenures became feudal, charged
with certain services.</p>

<p>Our translation, Gen. xlvii. 20, 21. says, “So
the land became Pharaoh’s; and as for the people,
he removed them to cities from one end of the
borders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof.”
In the Septuagint it is, “and the land became
Pharaoh’s, and he subjected the people to be servants
to him from one end of Egypt to the
other.” It is to the same purport in the Samaritan
copy. This reads better, and is more probable,
than that Joseph should have made the
whole nation, as Mr. Harris affirms, change settlements
in such a manner as if the people of Kent
were sent to the Orkneys, and those of the Orkneys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
were brought to Kent. This would be such
a trifling with peoples lives and feelings, such a
waste of property, such a perversion of all experience,
and particular knowledge of the agriculture
proper in each district, as is only applicable
to the Leverpool slave-trade; but cannot,
on such slight grounds as this general expression
is, be imagined in a man of Joseph’s character,
with a pretended view to prevent rebellion. Or
the expression in our translation may bear, that
the people were distributed so as to be near
the respective store-houses, on which their maintenance
was assigned.</p>

<p>Therefore “the change made, p. 25, 26, in the
happy condition of the Ægyptians, the transportation
of 7 or 8 millions of every age, sex, condition,
rank; infants, children, decrepit, infirm, delicate,
through the scorching sands of a parched up
country,” is the mere fiction of imagination, to
palliate the still more shocking conduct of the
writer’s patrons of Leverpool. The Ægyptians
offered themselves for servants, to save themselves
from starving. His patrons force the Africans to
be slaves, not as he says, from “a state of absolute
indigence,” but reduced from plenty and
ease to famine, nakedness, and want, by stripes,
fetters, cruelty and oppression.</p>

<p>Page 28. It is said, “Joseph, when able to
relieve them, took advantage of the extreme indigence
of the Ægyptians, to reduce them into
the condition of slaves, and in this acted by the
immediate direction of God, who made this work
to prosper.” Supposing all this true, yet there is
nothing common between this transaction and the
Leverpool African commerce; but the author’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
having given them one common name, “slave-trade.”
The Ægyptians, after a fair transfer of
themselves and goods, are left in full possession of
their lands and property, on paying such a rent as
would act as a spur to industry, while it checked
that luxury which the author describes, p. 25, as
prevailing in Ægypt. The Leverpool slaves are
reduced from freedom to a base, helpless, unprofitable,
wretched state.</p>

<p>When this writer, p. 27, considers the four-fifths
of the produce left with the Ægyptian farmer,
as only equivalent to the keep of a West-Indian
slave, he must raise a blush on the sugar
planter’s cheek; who willingly would leave but one
fifth, (the rum) both to support his plantation
stock, and maintain his slaves.</p>

<p>But let Joseph’s conduct be what the writer
pleases to describe it. He was not the legislator
of Ægypt, but the minister of Pharaoh, and obliged
to govern himself by the prevailing customs of
the kingdom. It appears, he extended only the
king’s revenues, and gave him such a command
over the property of the people, as might enable
him to arrange the management of it to the best
general advantage. This might be peculiarly
proper in Ægypt, though not necessary to be
imitated here. Its fertility depended on the
equal distribution of the waters of the Nile. It
was necessary for the general benefit, that there
should be an indisputed power to direct the course
of the various canals, which communicated the
water to each district. While the king had an
equal interest in all, no particular part would be
neglected. Joseph gives four-fifths of the produce,
“for feed of the field, and for your food,
and for them of your housholds, and for food for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
your little ones.” This confines the peoples share
to their own maintenance, and the supply of seed.
We are left to conclude, that every expense attending
the distribution of the river, except perhaps
manual labour, was paid out of the king’s fifth
part: and as in all good governments, the interest
of the king and the people is one, Joseph, by
his nominal purchase of the people and their
lands, might probably have in view such an accession
of power, as might enable him to direct
the whole to general advantage. After the charter
was confirmed, no ill use could be made of the
power, and an English farmer would gladly pay
one-fifth of his produce to him who should stock
his farm, and pay his rent, and all his publick and
parish taxes.</p>

<p>Page 38. “The Jews are not restrained from
purchasing their own brethren.” The Jews were
commanded to treat their brethren, when reduced
to a six years servitude, with lenity, as hired or
free servants, and to send them out in the sabbatical
year free, and not let them go away empty.
The only cases in which we can suppose Jews
could be made to serve, are their being sold for
debt, or their preferring the service of a master to
labour on their own account. In these cases, the
laws of Moses take care of them, that they be not
oppressed, and, besides the original purchase-money
of their services, to have a recompence
when the period is finished.</p>

<p>It is in this case of an Hebrew servant, that we
are to look for the genuine Mosaic principles of
slavery. Even here the law expresses a jealousy of
the master’s conduct, and guards against the abuse
of his authority, restricting it to six years, and prescribing
the manner of exercising it. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
when the Jews are allowed to make perpetual
slaves of the Heathen, we are to consider it as a
particular dispensation respecting their situation
among idolaters, by which, in every slave, they
made a proselyte to the true religion; or like divorces,
an indulgence to their hardness of heart,
which was not then capable of the purity and benevolence
of the gospel, by which, marriage was
made perpetual, and all men were to be treated as
brethren. We can infer the doctrine of perpetual
slavery as little from its permission to the Jews,
as we can the keeping of concubines from the
practice of Abraham, or David. Divorces are
permitted to the Jews in similar expressions with
the permission to hold slaves; yet our Saviour
tells us, it was not so from the beginning. Moses
(Deut. xvii. 14.) gives directions for the choice
and duty of a king, yet Samuel tells the Jews,
they had offended God in asking for a king. And
though God condescended to give them a king in
a manner which more unequivocally shewed his
assent, than that approbation, sanction and command,
which the author incautiously affirms to be
given to the “slave-trade;” yet Samuel concludes
them to be not the less guilty, for persevering in
the request. We should be more careful than this
author shews himself, how we apply our ignorant
conjectures to the divine conduct; as p. 16,
“Without allowing the licitness of the slave-trade,
it is impossible to reconcile the justice of
God with his own scriptural decisions concerning
its nature;” that (p. 32) “God, without a glaring
opposition to the rights of his justice, could
not have approved the conduct of Joseph in enslaving
the Ægyptians, and inflicted a lasting punishment
on Reuben for his incest, if his enslaving of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the Ægyptians had been a crime.” These expressions
would be shocking from an infidel; in
what an horrid cause doth a clergyman use them?</p>

<p>The minds of the Jews had been broken and
debased by the Egyptian bondage; the law was
given them as a school-master to train them up for
the perfect religion of the gospel. Their conduct
in the wilderness, their frequent rebellions amidst
miracles, and in the immediate presence of their
Divine Deliverer, can only be imagined by those
who have had opportunities of seeing how man is
shorn of his worth by slavery. Only two men of
all who were grown up when they came out of
Egypt, were thought deserving to enter into Canaan.
That whole generation must be worn out
in the wilderness; and their children must be
trained for 40 years before they are permitted to
take possession. Their laws therefore respected the
hardness of their hearts, though founded on principles
which led insensibly to perfection. Thus
while the perpetuity of the servitude of the Heathens
condescended to the hardness of their hearts,
the easy temporary service of their brethren looked
forward to the gospel times, not differing, but in
being for a fixed period, from modern servitude for
wages in free states.</p>

<p>Therefore when this writer, p. 39. calls this
latter service, “A Slave Trade;” the meaning of
the terms is perverted. Or let him reduce his Leverpool
slave trade to the circumstances of a Jew serving
his brother for six years, and we shall have few
objections to bring against it. What he calls there
“selling him again,” was transferring his service
to another brother (not an Heathen) for the remainder
of the term, as an apprentice is turned
over to a second master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Page 40. “If a Hebrew servant had married
a wife with consent of his master, she and her
child became her master’s property for ever.”
This seems not to be candidly expressed. This
wife must have been an Heathen slave, for Hebrew
women had the privilege of the Sabbatical
year; but if he chose to continue with his wife,
he had only to renew his contract with his master.
Indeed the regulation appears to have been intended
as a check to the connection with slaves in
the poor reduced Hebrews.</p>

<p>Page 41, 42. When he speaks of the (Leverpool)
“slave trade having the sanction of being
encouraged, almost commanded, and even enjoined,
to be prosecuted by the Supreme Legislator,”
he puts opposition to silence. But when,
p. 43. he talks of “the Almighty’s forgetting
himself, when he encouraged the slave trade, if it
be a crime,” I am happy for his sake to recollect,
that the author tells us, till he was 27 years old,
he knew not the value of an English expression.</p>

<p>Page 43. The slavery of the Gibeonites.</p>

<p>The land of Canaan was allotted to the Jews
for an inheritance. The former inhabitants, for
their sins, were to be extirpated, or expelled. The
Gibeonites preferred slavery to this. Their services
were allotted first to the tabernacle, then to
the temple. It appears from David’s application
to them, on account of the famine brought on the
land for Saul’s massacre of them, that they were
kept distinct as a people. We may suppose that
they continued to occupy part of their ancient possessions
(for we find in David’s time that even
Araunah a Jebusite was a proprietor of land)
and that they were in their turn draughted off for
the service of religion; those who occupied the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
lands maintaining those who served. There is not
one common circumstance between the manner of
their becoming servants, and the present Leverpool
slave trade, and hardly any more in their treatment.</p>

<p>Page 50. On the supposition of the iniquity
of the (Leverpool) “slave trade,” he speaks of the
Almighty disturbing the course of nature, when
the sun stood still at Joshua’s command, to make
it subservient to injustice and oppression, in vindication
of ill-gotten property. Here he may be
assured the horror of the expression will secure him
from contradiction.</p>

<p>Page 54. “The slave trade,” (still Leverpool
slave trade) “is in perfect harmony with the principles
of the word of God respecting justice.”
P. 58. “The inspired writers of the New Testament
did not consider it as an infraction of the
principles of the gospel.” Nor did these declare
their own persecution for righteousness sake, to be
an infraction of the principles of the gospel. The
keeping of slaves, which the author constantly calls
“the slave trade,” was a custom then generally prevalent
over the world. Neither were masters or slaves
prepared for a general manumission. The spirit of
Christianity was suffered gradually to undermine
this mass of oppression, and wherever the gospel
has prevailed, it has in fact abolished it.</p>

<p>We have a similar instance of this management,
in the abolition of the ceremonial law of Moses.
The first disciples, and even the apostles, conformed
to it, though they had declared it to be an unnecessary
yoke, and they suffered it to wear out gradually.
That slavery was an evil, and therefore a
sin in all those who inflicted it on others, in such
a degree as to become an evil, is plainly declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
in the gospel. Our Saviour tells the believing
Jews, If ye continue in my word, ye shall know
the truth, and the truth shall make you free; or
shall confer new privileges on you. If freedom be
a privilege or an advantage, slavery is a degradation
and a disadvantage. But if a man be degraded
or injured for the caprice or profit of another,
that other, under whom he suffers such
injury, is guilty of a sin.</p>

<p>Again, St. Paul, 1 Cor. viii. 21., says, “Art
thou called being a servant, care not for it; but
if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.” Here
is plainly a direction to the disciples to submit to
their situation, but to prefer freedom when fairly
offered; which in this case was its being purchased
for them by the Christian congregation. This is
explained, ver. 23. “Ye are bought with a price,
be not (Greek become not) ye the servants of men.”
Avoid a situation which must debase your mind.
In the Revelations, xviii. 13. slaves and souls of
men are said to be articles of traffick in Babylon,
the Mother of Abominations. This supposeth nothing
very excellent in slavery, to make it be approved
of, and commanded to be prosecuted by
God.</p>

<p>We may now account for the manner in which
St. Paul applies to Philemon in behalf of his servant
Onesimus. He desires him to receive him
back into his family, not now as a servant, but
above a servant; a profitable inmate, a brother
beloved. He would not take advantage of the
privilege of an apostle, to withhold Onesimus from
his service, or consider his conversion as a bar to
it, and therefore endeavours to effect a reconciliation
between them. But from the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
which the apostle solicits this favour, it is clear
the situation of Onesimus in the family was desirable;
for he requests it as a favour to Onesimus,
and considers not his interposition, as the conferring
of an obligation on Philemon. All this is
very opposite to that West-Indian slavery with
which this of Onesimus, p. 65. is compared. For
the master only is considered here; neither the
feelings nor profit of the slave is taken into account.</p>

<p>Page 72, 73. I shall not dispute his exposition
of doing as we wish to be done by, as far as it
goes, of “a slave’s serving his master, as he if a
master would wish to be served.” But I would
carry it a step farther. As I, a free man, settled
with my family and friends about me in my native
country, would not wish to be kidnapped, or to
have my family enslaved, separated, and carried
bound neck and heel, and stifled in the foul air
of a ship’s hold, all to be sold in a distant country,
to toil incessantly for a man we never knew,
without food or raiment, except such scraps as we
may procure by breaking the sabbath; under the
lash of any unfeeling boy, who may be set over us
with a whip in his hand; so would not I be concerned
in any such cruel oppressive inhuman treatment
of others. When this author publishes his
Second Part, it is to be hoped, this will be pressed
home on his Leverpool patrons.</p>

<p>It is curious to remark, that in these researches,
in which the wisdom and goodness of God is so
freely applied to the Leverpool slave trade, there
is not even a distant hint given of the purpose
which is to be served by slavery, to shew it to be
worthy “of this divine approbation, the almost
divine commands.” When God commands us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
to love our neighbour, our heart goes along with
the precept. But if, as this author incautiously
affirms, we be commanded to exercise the slave
trade, bow down our brother’s body in bondage,
and treat him ill, as Sarah did Hagar with impunity,
we have no clue to trace out the agreement
of the doctrine with divine goodness. If commanded
or enjoined to use the slave trade as it is
now carried on, we are commanded, (horrid even
in the supposition) to commit murder, to starve,
oppress, suffocate, and lead into exile, our brother,
who never offended us. Suppose slavery
approved of in revelation, yet surely robbery,
murder, and oppression, are not approved there:
and yet no man is originally reduced into a
state of slavery but by such methods:—at least,
when the advocates for slavery plead for a divine
sanction to it, they should be able to lay down a
method of making slaves of others, which shall
be innocent, and may deserve that sanction.</p>

<p>The Jews, for their sins, were given up to
captivity. Their cities were to be destroyed, their
princes murdered, and their people carried to
Babylon. The prophets invited the surrounding
nations to come to the slaughter, and to the spoil.
Here is a divine command in stronger terms than
can be shewn for the Leverpool slave trade, or any
other slave trade or holding of slaves. Yet what
follows. These very nations thus invited, and
even commanded to execute the divine judgments
on the Jews, are destined to destruction, are made
to cease as nations, for having obeyed the call to
vengeance. Edom was amongst the first in this
field of blood, and slavery, and plunder. Hear
the prophet Obadiah address him:—“Thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
shouldest not have laid hands on their substance
in the day of their calamity: thou shouldest not
have stood in the cross-way to cut off those of his
that did escape: thou shouldest not have delivered
up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.
For the day of the Lord is near on all the
heathen;—as thou hast done, it shall be done
unto thee.”</p>

<p>The reason is plain, though instruments in
God’s hands to punish a wicked people; yet in
the execution of his justice, they only satiated
their own hatred, cruelty, and avarice. Let therefore
the Leverpool slave trade be not only approved
of, but even, as he says, commanded by God;
yet if the corporation, in prosecuting the infernal
business, be actuated by avarice, or any other
unworthy motive, and use cruelty, oppression, and
inhumanity in the course of it, (and let those who
use the trade lay their hands on their hearts, and
let them, if they dare, deny the charge), then,
sooner or later, divine vengeance will find them
out, and plunge them into ruin with all those
who encourage or abet them in it.</p>

<p>Page 75. Corol. 1st. “The Scriptures declare
the slave trade to be intrinsically good and licit.”
Not in any other manner than Jewish arbitrary
divorces, plurality of wives, or their original
desire of a king; all of which we know to have
been wrong from the beginning.</p>

<p>Corol. 2d. “He is highly criminal who refuses
assent to the intrinsick licitness of the slave trade,
declared in the Scriptures.” I hope not, if he
cannot find it there, and resolves not to meddle
with it, till he has discovered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Corol. 3d. “He who acquiesces not in the
licitness of the slave trade, disbelieves the Scriptures.”
Answered in Corol. 2.</p>

<p>Corol. 6th. “The abuses of the slave trade
not an inducement to the Legislature to abolish
it.” If the slave trade be, as it certainly is, inseparably
connected with murder, oppression, and
every iniquity that has from time to time drawn
down divine vengeance on guilty nations; and if
the Legislature be instructed in the nature of it,
and be called on to put a stop to this murder and
oppression, and cannot possibly do it but by the
abolition of the slave trade, (were the slave trade
even commanded in the clearest terms, which is
not the case, but the contrary) then is the Legislature
obliged, and called on by every motive of
religion and prudence, to put an immediate stop
to it, that it may not bring ruin on the state.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
